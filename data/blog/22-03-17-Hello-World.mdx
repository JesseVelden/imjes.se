## Hello World!

👋 Hello world, welcome to my blog ! Finally, I found some time to work on my own website and start writing 📝.

I already had this domain imjes.se for quite some time, which I mostly use as a catch-all email address,
and it's a lot shorter to type than my full name domain: jessevandervelden.nl. So now I finally put it to full use!

My primary use-case for this site is to have a short showcase of my projects and previous works. Besides, I can now use this blog as
a tool to share my thoughts and ideas on my blog and improve my writing.

I think that great writing (whether it be a blog post or documentation) is becoming more important
for any successful open-source or commercial project. It is a great skill to explain things in a clear and honest way,
and people will notice and appreciate that.

So for a starter, let's get a quick dive in the tech that I've used 👇


## The making of this blog
### The inspiration
I have spent some time getting inspired by several blogs made with Next.js and discovered the
[Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
and [ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter) templates which seemed
to be an excellent starting point.
Both starters use markdown files which can relatively easily be converted into HTML using [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) .

On the [Tailwind Nextjs Starter documentation page](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog#examples)
there are some other cool personal blogs listed where I took inspiration from.

Later I found [Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) as an alternative to mdx-bundler which I
will explain in [more detail below](#the-blog). The documentation listed also some [nice other personal blogs](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer#who-is-using-contentlayer)
which I took also some inspiration from.

I created a moodboard by screenshotting parts that of other websites that I liked, and put it on a blank Figma canvas.
This is something that I do quite often if I need to think about designing webpages or parts of them. Then I compile the
best ideas together and add a touch of myself into it.




### The site
The main framework that I use is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It's a simple web server completely based on React components
which I already had extensive experience in at my previous jobs.
Next, the routing is easy, and it is possible to build a completely static website while having still the benefits of
interactivity and large ecosystem of React and the Next.js community.


### The styling

For the styling of my website I used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I think it is a great tool to use
for styling simple websites like this one. The syntax is simple and allows me to quickly iterate on the design with
sensible defaults. Even dark mode support is easy to set up, so you can switch themes easily by clicking the top-right
button in my menu bar.

In my first months of working with it, I constantly had the docs open in another tab. Now it almost feels seamless,
and the docs actually learned me a lot and made me more aware of all the features of CSS itself.

#### Some TailwindCSS considerations
I've also had the experience of TailwindCSS in a bigger commercial project. Then I noticed, if you're not carefully
extracting new components all the time and agreeing to extract some fundamental styles back in a CSS file, you can end
up quickly with a mess of component styles. Besides, overloading classes a component styled
with tailwind isn't a trivial task, and you need something like [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) to do that.

> As with every technology choice, it comes with advantages and trade-offs. For my own simple projects those trade-offs are
worth it, but in bigger teams and bigger codebases this can be different.

### The blog
It's nice to store blog posts on the file system without any kind of lock-in or connecting to databases.
I've decided to use [Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer), which
can be seen as a more integrated alternative to [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) for
converting markdown to HTML in Next.js.
Contentlayer takes the post's content and metadata and generates TypeScript types and JSON files for easy importing in React.
Besides, it can automatically hot reload markdown changes for a quick preview on my development website during writing.

Additionally, Contentlayer can be used to automatically generate other computed fields based on my post. Some examples
of things that I generate include:
* Estimated [reading time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time)
* Blurred image previews using the method described by [Lazar Nikolov's blog post](https://nikolovlazar.com/blog/generating-blur-for-dynamic-images-nextjs)
* Extracting a Table of contents of a markdown file using [markdown-toc](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc)
and using my own component


### The animations
#### imjes.se animation
On my homepage you can see my simple animation of the letters of my domain name _imjes.se_, being morphed to:
_I'm Jesse_. It's based on a SVG paths with two different paths for the _I_ and the _J_ which are being morphed
from lowercase to uppercase characters. I generated the SVG paths by creating text in Figma and exporting it to
an SVG path.

As I recognize that making SVG paths in Figma is a manual approach, using JavaScript for this to generate SVG paths
(which you could do by using [svg-text-to-path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-text-to-path))
I would only consider if I would have lots of these kinds of animations.

Next it was time to animate those letters! For this I used [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) which
has an easy API to animate and time animations from JS. It also played nicely with [flubber](https://github.com/veltman/flubber)
which I used for smooth interpolation of the lowercase and uppercase SVG paths.

A blog post with a more technical explanation and code-examples is coming!

#### Fade-ins
For the fade-ins on all my pages, I created a simple higher order component which would translate its content
in a nice and smooth way.

> Making this animations and using the Framer API reminded me a lot about the good old days
where I made my first PowerPoint presentations in primary school where I would tinker around and excessively animate and
orchestrate all different kinds of animations. It were fun times!

### Some other cool stuff
#### Automatic Open Graph images
A blog in 2022 wouldn't be complete without cool open graph images which you can see if you share a page of my
website on Twitter or Facebook for example. Making them manually can be cool but also time-consuming, so I've set
up a simple generator, which I will explain in a blog post another time.

#### Image lightbox
To complete the blog, I added a lightbox wrapper for all my images, so you can admire all the pictures in full detail
when you click on it.
For this I used [simple-react-lightbox](https://github.com/michelecocuccio/simple-react-lightbox), which was indeed
simple to set up!

## What's next?
Having a personal website resulted that I have learned new techniques and tools. It will be a place where I can
share my thoughts and improve my writing and this is for me what it's all about.

I am planning to post some technical articles, (for example some more details and
code examples about the techniques that I used for this website), but I am also going to write some articles about other
things that I find interesting and enjoy.

In the end I hope if these posts will help myself by writing about techniques & trade-offs, it will probably help also
someone else who is looking into the same things.

Thanks for reading, and hope to see you around here soon!
